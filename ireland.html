        <p>Located in County Clare, Ireland, the Cliffs of Moher is a very popular tourist destination.</p>
        <p>There is plenty to do and see such as visiting the museum and learning about the history of the Cliffs, taking a walk to O'Brien's Tower, &amp; taking pictures with your friends and family with the Cliffs in the background.</p>

        <h1>Family Vacation</h1>
        <p>My family and I went to Ireland in November of 2017 to visit with my dad's side of the family and tour the country.</p>
        <p>The first picture is of my two older sisters and me in front of the Cliffs of Moher. It was raining that day, but it looks like a really nice day.</p>
        <p>And the last picture is of my family and I before we went to a castle that I don't remember the name of.</p>
        <p>In Ireland, the driver's side is on the right side of the car and they drive on the left side of the road, so I was super disoriented when we got in the car.</p>
